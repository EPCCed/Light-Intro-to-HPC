To do: 
========
Content removed from the Intro-to-HPC course, perhaps re-add, [available here](removed-content.md)

Throughout: 
------------
* Add more photos (Removed the irrelevant stock photos, perhaps we can use the ARCHER2 image comp?) 
* Add more interactive content (some quizzes etc have been commented out but still remain as examples)
* Will need to do a spell-check -> doesn't always show up. 


Part 1: 
--------
* This part is largely broad-stroke introductions to later sections -> can we go through an link everything together? I.e. "see this later in part X"
* World_of_Supercomputing is really long, maybe this should be subdivided.
    * Can we reduce some of the Moore's Law content? This is also reproduced in Part2.  
* Add a quick cheat sheet summary onto the end of part 1 - as this is so introductory it will be useful for people to refer to later on. 

Part 2: 
-------
* Need to test the supercomputing game...
