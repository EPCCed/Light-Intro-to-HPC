# High Performance Computing and Society

<!-- This is the first landing/introductory page of the course -->

## About the course

This course aims to introduce users to the world of supercomputing, how it affects society, our every day lives and the how the hardware, software and operating environments differ from the computing systems that you may find in the average household. This course will hopefully explain the benefits that high performance computing can offer both of terms of performance and the scale of calculations that it allows us to undertake. 

## Who is the course for?

Anyone who is interested in high performance computing and wishes to know more. This material is introductory and aims to give an initial lead in to more specialised topics.
